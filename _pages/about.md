I‚Äôm Jiashuo Zhang (Âº†ÂÆ∂Á°ï), a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. [Zhong Chen](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1062/1605.htm). I obtained my Bachelor‚Äôs degree from the School of Computer Science at Peking University. Currently, I am working at the [InfoSec Lab](https://infosec.pku.edu.cn/) and  [Blockchain Research Center](https://brc.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. I expect to graduate in 2026.
